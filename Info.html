   <p>Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and it has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots. </p>

 <p>In Minesweeper, mines are scattered throughout a board.

  A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game. Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. players must uncover all non-mine cells.   Flagging all the mined cells is not required.</p>
